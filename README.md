Vitorian: Code Challenge #1

There are two targets:
- `test`: contains tests for the code
- `client`: contains the actual client connecting to
  `challenge1.vitorian.com:9009`. The implementation is `client.cpp`.

To compile and run (with either g++ or clang++):
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
./client
```
